# Core Topics

Each file in this directory contains information about a particular topic. Such
files detail the following:

- Prerequisites -> What the participants need to know/do before starting
    - This is usually admin tasks technical issues do not detract from
    everyone's time

- Learning objectives -> What the participants are expected to know after
finishing
    - These are split into 3 categories:
        - Novice -> Everyone should be able to do this by the end
        - Intermediate -> Will be taught, but it is not necessary for all users
        to be able to do this by the end
        - Advanced -> Some users might pick up the content very quickly.
        Instead of removing them from the session, you might want to encourage
        them learning some additional material

- Proposed Activities -> Proposed ways the instructor can achieve the learning
objectives
    - It is ultimately up to the instructor how they deliver the content, but
    some suggestions are given
    - I (Sam Fletcher) believe that lecturing adults won't lead to much
    understanding. Most computational topics are best learned through
    exploration due to the sheer amount of potential content
